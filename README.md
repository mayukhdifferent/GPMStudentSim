## Description

GPM Student Simulator is the result of a week long academic project to design and implement a systems-dense game entirely within a spreadsheet. The game is a prototype sim of being a student in the Games and Playable Media Program at UCSC. Manage stress, health, and 
academic performance to keep up with the program and stay healthy!

## Usage

The entirety of the game is available in the GPMSimFinal.xlsm file. Microsoft Excel is required to run it, and macros must be enabled. 

The systems diagram is also available in the docs, which can be run on https://ncase.me/loopy/ by Nicky Case.
